# Editorial and Production Workflow
This section speaks broadly to the question of how to incorporate each of the three different Manifold project conceptions into your workflow, with suggestions on where to delineate work between you, the publisher, and the author(s).

## Open-Access
In this scenario the production workflow is largely unchanged from your existing procedures. When you have a final version of your Text (congruent with typeset-ready text or a final, copyedited manuscript) in an acceptable format, you can begin a new project in the system and upload that Text, along with general project and author information, cover and author images, and industry standard metadata (as appropriate). You will have the chance to review the material to make sure it has translated onto the platform as expected before pushing it live. Authors, in collaboration with you, may need to supply additional metadata and image files (avatars, banner suggestions), depending on your expectations for the project.

## Enhanced
As with the Open-Access model, the production process remains mostly unchanged from your existing procedures. In addition to loading a Text, you will also upload Resource files that augment and enhance the Text. This will involve a staff member reviewing the quality and usability of the materials as well as evaluating them for any permission concerns. Metadata input for Resources can be modest, though the platform does allow for a robust collection of information, depending on your needs and expectations. The placement of Resources in the Text(s) or in curated collections can be accomplished either by the author or in-house staff.

## Iterative
The iterative process precedes and stands apart from the standard production workflow. After an agreement on the nature of the project and the kinds of materials it will comprise is brokered with the author, the author can begin supplying Texts and Resources to you for vetting and loading into the system, which both parties can then curate.

### Responsibilities
*   Vetting and editing materials to house standards and expectations
*   Advising authors on permission concerns
*   Collaborating with authors on how to structure materials for the platform
*   Preparing and loading author materials into the system
*   Trouble-shooting platform concerns

*Note*. Compare these responsibilities with those of the author's, as found in the [Iterative Project Proposals and Process](proposals.md) section.

### Considerations
*   Sketch out a staff map of who will be involved, what is expected of them, and for what parts of the process? Will this be true of every project, or will different staff be used for different projects?
*   How will you treat Resources versus Texts in terms of editorial oversight and vettingâ€”will those concerns be decided by acquisitions, editorial, or production staff?
*   Do you want to create a pipeline for iterative projects to flow through into standard production processes or should they remain completely distinct, with a handoff from one process to another?
*   Staff skills that will be useful:
    *   Basic familiarity with HTML (and its structure)
    *   Understanding of how cascading style sheets (CSS) function
    *   Experience using content-management systems

## Text Ingestion
Manifold can ingest Texts in various formats. The preferred method is by way of EPUB, but Markdown, HTML, and Google Documents are also viable means. The diagram shown here describe the various paths for getting your Texts into Manifold from your existing procedures.

*Note*. If your Text is a Microsoft Word Document (or a series of them), you'll need to first transform them from Word to an accepted format, via one of the suggested paths here, before uploading them into the system.
