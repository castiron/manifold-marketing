# Copyright and Permissions
All materials you or your co-authors did not personally create will need to be accounted for on the [permission log](permission-log.md/). Even those that are in the public domain should appear here to for a complete record of the project's assets.

Excepting original text written specifically for this project and brief textual excerpts from primary and secondary materials, all resources will need to be accounted for on the 000 form.

Permission Prep: a brief para. with pertinent info after header followed by page of info. Maybe something like:

All items not your own need to be documented. Permission will be necessary for all items not presently in the public domain (see more here). Fair use rulings will be made by the press.

## Ethical Concerns
Reproducing thoughts and materials from any community involves more than just legal precedent. Please be aware of and sympathetic to any mores the peoples and cultures with whom you are working hold with regard to your research and publishing plans. Be open, honest, and precise in your discussions with what you want to use and the means by which you intend to distribute itâ€”in print, online, open access. Don't assume you can use materials without offense, or that permission to use them in one way suggests permission to use them in others, without being specifically cleared to do so.

## Copyright Concerns
There are many gray areas in copyright law, especially as regard fair use, and your publisher will have its own distinct set of standards under which it operates. With that in mind, the following are items to be aware of as you conduct your research:

*	Anything _published_ before 1923 is in the public domain and can be used freely.
*	Materials created before 1923 _but never before published_ may still be in copyright.
*	Materials that are freely available in public spaces (e.g., on the Internet) are not, simply because of their location, in the public domain. The standard criteria that applies to other works applies equally to them.
*	If you are securing materials from an archive or museum, there are two distinct forms of permission in play: (1) copyright and (2) access. The former speaks to copyright law, the latter to that particular institution's guidelines in allowing researchers to use materials in their keeping.

	In some cases materials may have been donated under conditions that limit how they can be used.

	Similarly, an institution can limit your access to representations of works of art in the public domain. Gaining access to those materials generally requires the permission of the housing agent.

	Work with archivists and reference librarians in ascertaining what kinds of permissions, if any, you'll need for the materials you are interested in reproducing.

*	Poetry and song lyrics tend to be specials cases for most presses. Consult with your editor on how best to proceed when you are wanting to include such materials. As a general guideline, if you are using more than ten lines, ten percent, or a full stanza (regardless of its length), of material published from 1923 on permission will be necessary.
*	For interview materials, be they audio, video, or transcribed, you will need permission from your institution's interview review board (if applicable) and the interviewee(s). Some presses will require written confirmation from each party, others only your confirmation that all parties were agreeable to your use of the material. You will also need consent from any party who taped, recorded, or transcribed the sessions in question.

The [Cornell Copyright Information Center site](http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm) is a great resource in determining whether the materials you are interested using are in the public domain or not. If they are not, consult with your editor on how best to proceed before submitting or paying for permission. It's possible your use may be considered a Fair one or that alternative resources exist that will be better options permissions-wise.

## Permission Request Language
When requesting permission, especially when requesting permission for a
Including materials on Manifold requires permission from rights holders to ```reproduce material in both print and electronic formats throughout the world for the life of the project.```

This language effectively asks that rights holders provide you permission to use their material in your project regardless of the medium in which it is presented and so long as the project is supported throughout the world. Removing territory, term, and medium restrictions is imperative for works that are to be consumed, even in part, online.

Consult with your editor if rights holders ask for a specific number of print copies for which they are also ultimately granting permission. Your editor will be able to provide you a ballpark number as well as alert you to any possible complications that may arise from their print-on-demand (POD) strategy.

<!-- Add some thoughts about British law and fair dealing and all that. -->
<!-- Beef up the section about working with publisher first before asking for permission on items that aren't clear cut. -->
<!-- What does it mean to be published only in the US for works that will appear online? Is "published by a US house" congruent or not so much?
