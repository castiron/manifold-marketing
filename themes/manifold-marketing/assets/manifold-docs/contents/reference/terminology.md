# Terminology

There are some terms used throughout Manifold's documentation where the meaning might not be clear if you are a new user. This page attempts to document the most critical terms. If you don't see something you're looking for, please consult the [glossary](/contents/reference/glossary.md).

**Projects** are the core unit of Manifold. Each Manifold project can be composed of Texts and Resources. They are a project's foundation.

**Texts** refer to static, prose-driven materials that have been processed into the [Manifold Reader](/contents/reference/glossary.md) and which could be replicated exactly in print as they appear on the screen. Generally, though not necessarily, Texts can be thought of as author-original content: field notes; draft or sample chapters; blog posts; ruminations and explorations of topics related to the project; or final, copyedited manuscripts. Static figures and tables that are essential to the discussion, and more than complimentary or contextual, are embedded into Texts. See the [Writing for the Web](/contents/authors/writing_for_the_web.md) section for more details and to learn how to prepare your textual materials for the system.

**Ingestion** are TKTKTK.

**Ingestion Strategy** is TKTKTK

**Users** are TKTKTK

**Makers** are TKTKTK

**Resources** are static or dynamic ancillary media that enhance and contextualize Texts. Resources can stand alone, be curated into collections, or layered directly onto and accessed from the Text. Commenting features are enabled for all Resources, and comments made to Resources follow them from wherever they may be accessed: in the text, the project's Resource library, or within a curated collection or like Resources. Manifold is designed to allow for as many different Resource types as possible, from documents, figures, tables, audio, video, to presentations, downloadable apps, and network visualizations. For details about the different kinds file formats and preferred specifications for Resources that are available to the system, please see the [resources](/contents/presses/the_backend/projects/resources/README.md) section
